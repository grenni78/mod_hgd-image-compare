# MOD HGD Image Compare

A Joomla 3.x Module which creates a small widget for comparing two images side by side. In the middle of the two images, there will be small dragable bar with which a website visitor can adjust the portions displayed of each image.

The module settings should be self explaining. The settings regarding the background are for customizing the draggable bar and the handle. With the alpha - field the background's transparency could be set. 100 means full opaque und a value of 0 means fully transoparent.
